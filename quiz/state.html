<h1>State Management Quiz</h1>

    1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: A POST cannot be bookmarked. Attempting to bookmark a POST will just result in a GET operation on the URL.
    There's a very good reason for this, GET requests are supposed to be idempotent - that is, making the same GET
    request numerous times should result in the same response. POST requests on the other hand are not.
</blockquote>
    2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Request Dispatcher is an interface whose implementation defines an object which can dispatch the request
    to any resources on the server. ... RequestDispatcher interface is used to forward or include the response of a
    resource in a Servlet.
</blockquote>
    3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: A RequestDispatcher forward() is used to forward the same request to another resource whereas ServletResponse
    sendRedirect() is a two step process. In sendRedirect(), web application returns the response to client with status
    code 302 (redirect) with URL to send the request.
</blockquote>
    4. What is an attribute ?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: An object bound into one of the three servlet API objects
        -HttpServletRequest
        -HttpSession
        -ServletContext
    Is a name value pair
        -value has type Object
        -name is String
</blockquote>
    5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Attribute and parameter are two terms associated with programming. ... The difference between attribute
    and parameter is that an attribute is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a class while a
    parameter is a variable defined by the function that receives a value when it is called.
</blockquote>
    6. What are dangers of using attributes?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Attributes are shared by every servlet and every request in the application and have to be careful, not thread safe.
</blockquote>
    7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of
    the requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between the browser and
    the server is also lost.
</blockquote>
    8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
    method).
<blockquote>
    ANSWER:
    1. Request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request
    2. Session scope: destroyed when user closes browser
    3. Application scope destroyed when Container stopped.
    4. Cookies saved on browser, temporary (deleted when the browser closes) or permanent.
    5. Hidden fields on a form.
</blockquote>
    9. How long does a session last?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: If there is not session-timeout defined in web.xml configuration, the container decides this setting.
    This setting decides how long a session last.
</blockquote>
    10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece
    of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing.
    There are 2 types:
        -Temporary cookie: browser removes when it closes
        -Permanent cookies: cookies that has max age set.
</blockquote>
    11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: URL rewriting is the process of modifying Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for various purposes.
    The URL as a “web address” is a string that, when entered into the browser bar field, directs the browser
    to move to a given site and page. ... URL rewriting is also known as URL manipulation.
</blockquote>
    12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Because the web server build the request object, then pass to web container. Then if setting
    the attribute to the request object, it will not be copied to the client. Request scope is destroyed
    when servlet finishes processing request.
