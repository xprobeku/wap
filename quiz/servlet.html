<h1>Introduction to Servlets Quiz</h1>
<p align="left">
    1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Typically, a Web server refers to an execution infrastructure that handles HTTP requests and responses;
    a servlet container refers to a component that handles the lifecycle for servlets; an application server
    refers to a framework (servlet container, EJB container, JSP engine, MQ container, etc.)
</blockquote>
2. What is a servlet?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: A servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of
    servers that host applications access by means of a
    request-response programming model.
</blockquote>
3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: A web container handles requests to servlets, that include server-side code.
    The Web container creates servlet instances, loads and unloads servlets,
    creates and manages request and response objects, and performs other servlet-management tasks.
</blockquote>
4. Who creates request objects?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Search Results
    Featured snippet from the web
    When a client sends a request to the web server, the servlet container creates ServletRequest & ServletResponse
    objects and passes them as an argument to the servlet's service() method. The request object provides the access
    to the request information such as header and body information of request data.
</blockquote>
5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Servlet states: Load, Create, Init, Service, Destroy
</blockquote>
6. Who calls init and when?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Servlet container calls init to initialize a servlet. The init() is called when servlet is created.
</blockquote>
7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Override init() method to do some initialization when the server created.
    service() is the main method to perform the actual task. The servlet container calls the service() method
    to handle requests coming from the client( browsers) and to write the formatted response back to the client.
    Override it to do some common operations when handling incoming request.
    doGet method is called when there is GET request comes and servlet needs to handle. We often override doGet
    and doPost to handle GET request from client.
</blockquote>
8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: This means a single instance can be accessed by more than one thread. If a servlet implements
    the SingleThreadModel interface, the container will not execute the service () method in more than one
    thread simultaneously.
</blockquote>
9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?<br>
<blockquote>
    ANSWER: Using this to access servlet instance variable, but just can be executed by threads launched by servlet container.
